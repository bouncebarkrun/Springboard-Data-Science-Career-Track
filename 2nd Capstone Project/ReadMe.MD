<b>Introduction</b>

Net neutrality is defined as “the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.” In the United States the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has for several years classified the internet as a telecommunications service in order to protect net neutrality.

In 2018, the net neutrality order was rescinded by the FCC after a 6 month public commentary period. Interestingly, text analysis of the FCC comments from the public demonstrated that many, if not the majority, of comments were fake. Due to public outcry at the reversal of net neutrality, a measure of disapproval is expected to be voted upon in the US Senate.

Twitter is an online news and social media platform with approximately 330 million active users. Given that users of Twitter are by its very nature users of internet services, sentiment analysis of tweets could provide a strong case for lawmakers trying to understand the true public consensus on the subject or how their constituents wish the issue to be handled. Montana and New York, for example, have already enacted its own legal protections to force net neutrality from providers contracted with the state.

By providing a detailed analysis of current tweets on the subject, this information could be used by a political lobbying company to persuade state and national representatives to vote according to the position of the voters they represent.

<b>Analysis</b>

The sentiment of the tweets about net neutrality was, on average, positive. Further investigation into the most positive and negative items indicated that tweets supporting the maintainance of net neutrality were of positive sentiment and negative sentiment was directed towards the idea of a repeal. That is, the collected tweets were largely in favor of retaining net neutrality.

Considering that the public commentary submitted to the FCC was used in making the decision to repeal net neutrality, and has since been shown to be highly populated with fake pro-repeal comments, it should be of strong interest for lawmakers to know what the true public sentiment is.

Currently, the US Senate votes for/against net neutrality fall largely on party lines, with only one dissenting Republican vote in favor of preserving net neutrality. Senate "sentiment" regarding net neutrality was calculated by state as follows: 1.0 if both of a state's Senators would vote to preserve net neutrality, 0.0 if the state is split between the two, and -1.0 if both Senators would vote against net neutrality.

The average sentiment for the tweets, by state, was generated and compared to the US Senate sentiment. The sentiment of the Senators appears to have very little to do with the sentiment of their constituents, when it comes to net neutrality.

<b>Client Recommendations</b>

Based on the results presented, the following recommendations could be provided to the political lobbying firm client (The Internet Association):

* Preliminary analysis of Twitter data as a surrogate for public opinion demonstrates that the American people favor preservation of net neutrality much like many of the firm's high tech clients. A strong media campaign should be undertaken to distribute this information.
* For each member of the Senate who is currently listed as a vote in favor of the net neutrality repeal, and those "on the fence:"
Present the data on sentiment across the country and by state.
Identify technology/internet companies in each "no" state that would stand to lose business opportunities if the net neutrality repeal is finalized and present those project losses in state revenue.
* For Senators in favor of preservation of net neutrality, schedule similar meetings to share the sentiment results and highlight that their vote matches the will of their constituents.
* Perform an analysis of economic benefits for the states that enacted their own net neutrality laws and use this to further the argument for prevention of a national repeal.
* Should the national effort to prevent a net neutrality repeal fail, enact the same strategy on an individual state basis.

<b>Future Work</b>

This project provided perspective on the benefits and limitations of a real-time analysis; immediately spotting spikes in tweet volume and changes in topics as events happened provided validation that the code was sensitive to the events.

Labeled data would have been incredibly useful to generate a predictive model and further evaluate the sentiment of fresh tweets on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately labeling over 400,000 tweets was not within the scope of this project. If such a set were available in the future, more extensive analysis and model testing could be performed.
